# Database Reference

**Status:** Observed — verified against game build 2117304-0-shipping (September 2026). Re-verify after a game update.

The dedicated server keeps all world state in one PostgreSQL 17.4 database,
`dune`. The console reads and writes the same database. Almost none of that
schema is defined by this repo — it ships inside the closed-source server
image and changes when Funcom ships a build.

That last point governs how to read this document. It describes *mechanisms*
that have been stable across builds — how encryption is layered, how
partitions are created, how the game signals running map servers — and
deliberately does **not** transcribe the ~490 functions or ~186 tables, which
drift. For the current inventory, regenerate it ([§10](#10-patches-and-drift)) rather than trusting a
list written down months ago.

## 1. Scope and vintage

One database serves everything: world state, player accounts, guilds, the
exchange, Landsraad, and the console's own bookkeeping. There is no separate
admin database — the console stores its settings in JSON files under
`runtime/generated/`, not in Postgres.

### Checking your own vintage

The game records its own schema patches. This is the authoritative marker,
and it is available on any deployment:

```bash
docker exec dune-postgres psql -U dune -d dune -Atc "select name, date from dune.applied_patches order by date desc limit 5"
```

Recent rows look like `DA-22428_implement_retroactive_story_completion_rewards`
with a timestamp. Compare against the vintage in this document's status line
before relying on any specific claim below.

Do **not** use `dune.get_schema_version()` for this. It exists, but returns
the sentinel `999999` rather than a meaningful version.

### Two roles

The console connects as the **`dune`** role (`console/api/src/db.js`).
`runtime/scripts/update-db.sh` connects as **`postgres`** — patch application
needs privileges the console deliberately does not hold. If you are writing a
console query, assume the `dune` role's permissions, not yours at a `psql`
prompt.

---

## 2. Connections and ownership

Two independent writers share this database:

| Writer | Connection | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| The dedicated server (closed source) | its own, not visible to us | virtually the entire schema |
| This project (Console and runtime scripts) | the Console's `pg` pool, or `dune_psql` from runtime scripts ([§2.1](#21-how-runtime-scripts-connect)) | the project-owned objects in [§9](#9-project-authored-objects) |

They are separate OS processes. The console's pool object is not shared with
the game server in any way; the two simply agree on a database.

Connection settings resolve in `discoverDbConfig()`
([db.js:19](https://github.com/Red-Blink/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker/blob/main/console/api/src/db.js)): `ADMIN_DATABASE_URL` wins outright
if set, otherwise the `DUNE_DB_*` / `PG*` variables supply host, database,
user and password. **Port is the exception** — it always delegates to
`resolvePorts()` rather than reading `DUNE_DB_PORT` directly, so that the
port the console connects on can never disagree with the port
status/preflight reports. The source comment explains the misconfiguration
this prevents; don't reimplement the precedence chain anywhere else.

### 2.1 How runtime scripts connect

Runtime scripts do not open a pool. They query through a seam that exists in
two languages, because the publishers are written in two:

| Caller | Entry point | File |
|---|---|---|
| shell, as the superuser | `dune_psql`, `psql_value` | [`runtime/scripts/lib/postgres.sh`](https://github.com/Red-Blink/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker/blob/main/runtime/scripts/lib/postgres.sh) |
| shell, as the `dune` role | `dune_psql_app`, `psql_app_value` | [`runtime/scripts/lib/postgres.sh`](https://github.com/Red-Blink/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker/blob/main/runtime/scripts/lib/postgres.sh) |
| an embedded `python3 - <<PY` block | `dune_psql.query_tsv` | [`runtime/scripts/dune_psql.py`](https://github.com/Red-Blink/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker/blob/main/runtime/scripts/dune_psql.py) |

They read the same `DUNE_PSQL_TRANSPORT` and `POSTGRES_PORT`, and pick one of
two transports:

| Transport | Used when | How |
|---|---|---|
| `tcp` | a real `psql` client is on `PATH` | `psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p $POSTGRES_PORT` |
| `exec` | it is not | `docker exec dune-postgres psql` |

**The seam does not change which role a query runs as.** Most of these
queries were already `-U postgres` before the conversion, and they use
`dune_psql`. Nine across `deferred-reconcile.sh`, `farm-readiness.sh` and
`repair-chat-exchanges.sh` were `-U dune`, and they use `dune_psql_app`, which
connects as the application role: owner of the `dune` database, authenticated
with `DUNE_DB_PASSWORD`, and not a superuser. Only the TCP leg sends a
password at all — the exec leg reaches the server over its Unix socket, which
the image trusts, which is how every one of these queries authenticated before
the seam existed. `tests/psql-transport-test.sh` names those three scripts and
fails if one of them reaches for a superuser entry point, because a promotion
is invisible in a diff that only shows the exec disappearing.

`auto` (the default) chooses between them on the first query of each process;
set `DUNE_PSQL_TRANSPORT` in `.env` to pin one. Neither the transport nor the
port is settled when the library is *sourced* or *imported*, deliberately:
several callers (`spawn-server.sh`, `start-all.sh`) read `.env` well after
their `source` lines, and resolving eagerly would pin the default port for
them no matter what the operator configured. The detection is a `type -P` /
`shutil.which` probe, deliberately not `command -v`, because `command -v`
would also be satisfied by a *shell function* named `psql` — and this
repository used to define one whose whole body was a container exec.

The duplication is the point and it is fenced: `tests/psql-transport-test.sh`
diffs the Python constants against the shell ones, so a changed superuser,
database, container name or default port fails there rather than in
production.

Both legs reach the same database, so this is purely a question of cost. A
container exec is not a connection: it forks a new process pair per
statement, and the autoscaler issues them continuously, several per scan
tick, for as long as the stack is up. On Podman each exec also rewrites the
ExecIDs array in the container database, which turned a mostly idle server
into a sustained tens-of-MB/s write load. The TCP leg reuses the published
loopback port the stack already exposes and costs one short-lived
connection instead.

#### Which callers are on the seam

The dividing line is *how often a caller runs*, not what it queries:

- **Unattended loops, timers and publishers go through the seam** — the
  autoscaler and its publishers, `publish-deepdesert-overrides.sh` (which
  re-queries every ten seconds and fans out over every partition),
  `publish-deepdesert-state.sh`, `publish-sietch-overrides.sh`,
  `validate-sietch-state.sh`, `farm-readiness.sh` (reached from both publisher
  hot paths), `restart-schedule.sh`, `deferred-reconcile.sh`,
  `spicefield-overrides.sh` and `repair-chat-exchanges.sh`.
- **Operator-invoked one-shots may keep a raw `docker exec`** — `db.sh`,
  `doctor.sh`, `status.sh`, the `patch-*` and `probe-*` scripts,
  `init-database.sh`, `update-db.sh`. One exec costs nothing when a human
  typed the command, several pipe a `.sql` file in on stdin, and
  `start-postgres.sh` has to work *before* any port is published.

That boundary is an allowlist in `tests/psql-transport-test.sh`, diffed
against what the tree actually contains, so a **new** raw-exec caller fails
the test until someone adds it on purpose. The same test rejects a
`["docker", "exec", ...]` argv list built anywhere but `dune_psql.py`, which
is how four publishers evaded an earlier, grep-for-the-shell-string version of
this guard and kept exec'ing at ~1.8 statements a second.

`coriolis-data-cleanup.sh` stays on a direct `docker exec`: it pipes a heredoc
on stdin, which the seam does not cover because both legs read from
`/dev/null`. Its `dune` role is no longer a reason — `dune_psql_app` connects
as that role — so if it ever stops needing stdin it can move onto the seam
like the rest.

#### Where the client lives, and how the configuration reaches it

- **Both images that run publisher loops ship `postgresql-client`** — the
  orchestrator image and the console image. The console's did not, so every
  query from the web admin took the exec leg however correctly the script was
  written; CI now runs `psql --version` against the built console image so a
  dropped package fails the build rather than quietly doubling the exec rate.
  `dune doctor` asks *both* seams inside *both* running containers which leg
  they took, and names the two reasons an answer of `exec` has — a stale image
  with no client, or a pinned `DUNE_PSQL_TRANSPORT`. The fallback is silent
  and correct, just expensive, so nothing else would surface it.
- **The exec leg is load-bearing, not vestigial.** The same scripts run
  directly on the host, from the `dune` CLI and `start-all.sh`, where a
  `psql` client usually is not installed.

The operator's configuration has to reach both halves, by different routes.
Addressing the container by name meant the published port never mattered, so
every host script that queries the database now reads `.env` itself — without
that, a stack whose `POSTGRES_PORT` was remapped (see
[`MULTI-SERVER-SINGLE-PUBLIC-IP.md`](https://github.com/Red-Blink/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker/blob/main/docs/runtime/MULTI-SERVER-SINGLE-PUBLIC-IP.md))
would dial the default port as soon as a `psql` client was installed. Scripts
whose queries run in embedded Python follow `. ./.env` with a targeted
`export POSTGRES_PORT DUNE_PSQL_TRANSPORT`, because a child interpreter reads
them from its environment — targeted rather than `set -a`, which would hand
every other secret in `.env` to every child process as well.

Inside a container the same route works: both the autoscaler and the console
bind-mount the repo root, so a script that sources `.env` finds it. The
exception is `autoscaler.sh`, which is written to be configured entirely by its
environment and never reads the file — which is why `start-autoscaler.sh` and
`start-coriolis-coordinator.sh` pass `POSTGRES_PORT` and `DUNE_PSQL_TRANSPORT`
in with `-e`, and why `dune autoscaler` exports `.env` before running it in the
foreground.

---

## 3. Schemas and extensions

Four schemas may be present:

- **`dune`** — primarily the game, with a small set of project-owned
  operational objects listed in [§9](#9-project-authored-objects). All other
  tables, views, functions, procedures and types discussed below live here
  unless stated otherwise.
- **`ext`** — extensions only, kept out of `dune` deliberately:
  `pg_trgm` (trigram text search) and `pgcrypto` ([§4](#4-the-encryption-layer)).
- **`console_market_history`** — console-owned exchange history
  ([§9](#9-project-authored-objects)).
- **`dune_runtime`** — project-owned compatibility state, created only when a
  relevant patch needs it ([§9](#the-dune_runtime-compatibility-schema)).

---

## 4. The encryption layer

Player-identifying data is encrypted at rest, and the tables you would expect
to query are **views that decrypt on read**:

| What you query | What actually stores it |
|---|---|
| `dune.accounts` | `dune.encrypted_accounts` |
| `dune.player_state` | `dune.encrypted_player_state` |

`dune.accounts` is defined as a projection over `dune.encrypted_accounts` that
passes `encrypted_funcom_id` through `dune.decrypt_user_data()` to produce the
`funcom_id` column. The encrypted columns are not readable without it.

Consequences worth knowing before writing a query:

- **You cannot index or efficiently filter on a decrypted column.** A
  `where funcom_id = $1` scans and decrypts. Filter on `id` or another
  plaintext column where possible.
- **Writes must go to the underlying table**, not the view.
- Encryption is toggled by the procedure
  `dune.setup_user_data_encryption(boolean)`. Do not call it casually — it
  rewrites stored data.

The third view, `dune.active_server_ids`, is unrelated to encryption but easy
to miss: it reports which map servers are *currently connected* by joining
`dune.farm_state` against `pg_stat_activity`, matching the connection's
`application_name` against `DuneSandbox - (.*)`. It reflects live connections,
not configuration — a configured-but-down map does not appear.

| Misc/operational | `applied_patches`, `game_events`, `factions`, `network_address_config`, `sinkcharts`, `shiftingsands_data`, `tax_invoice`, `vendor_stock_cycle`, `vendor_stock_state` | — |

One warning that belongs here regardless. The shipped schema contains the
studio's own debugging and migration debris. These are not console tables,
are not documented by Funcom, and must never be written to or cleaned up:

`da_6358_broken_players_1300`, `da_6358_broken_players_12400`,
`da_6358_pre_broken_players`, `da_12319_faction_rank_backup`,
`debug_test_table`, `demo_users`, `temp_items_dune_161802`,
`temp_contract_tags_backup_164545`

Their presence is normal. Their absence on a newer build is also normal.

---

## 6. Partitioning

`dune.world_partition` is the driver. Inserting a row there fires two
triggers, and the event log for that partition is created as a side effect:

- `partitions_inserted_trigger` → `dune.determine_partition_label_trigger()`
- `trigger_create_event_log_partition` → `dune.create_event_log_partition()`,
  which calls the procedure
  `dune.create_event_log_partition_table(table_name text, partition_id bigint)`

The result is the `dune.event_log_p*` family — 58 tables on the verified
build, which is why a raw table count (186) looks alarming next to the ~127
tables that actually carry distinct meaning.

Practical effect: **never `insert into dune.world_partition` by hand.** A row
there provisions tables.

`world_partition` is also where the game's map/dimension/partition addressing
lives — the `map`, `dimension_index` and `partition_definition` columns. That
model, and why world state must be keyed by `(map, dimension_index)`, is
covered in [`WORLD-MODEL.md`](WORLD-MODEL.md).

---

## 7. Routines, and why direct DML often does nothing

The single most important thing to understand about this database: **the game
ships stored procedures that notify running map servers, and a plain
`UPDATE` does not.**

A map server holds world state in memory. Writing a row that the server
already has loaded changes the database and nothing else — the server
overwrites it on its next flush, or simply never reads it again. The shipped
procedures exist precisely to emit the notification that makes a change take
effect live.

So before writing any mutation, check whether a shipped procedure covers it.
If one does, call it.

### Notify channels

Eight channels exist on the verified build, listed with how many call sites
each has in the schema:

| Channel | Call sites |
|---|---|
| `guild_notify_channel` | 12 |
| `landsraad_notify_channel` | 11 |
| `party_notify_channel` | 9 |
| `permission_notify_channel` | 7 |
| `taxation_notify_channel` | 6 |
| `faction_notify_channel` | 2 |
| `vehicle_recovery_notify_channel` | 1 |
| `player_info_notify_channel` | 1 |

**There is no channel for inventory or buildings.** No amount of correct SQL
will make an inventory change appear in a running client — the player must
relog. Any console feature touching items has to say so in its UI rather than
implying a live effect. See
[base-inventory.md](../console/base-inventory.md).

### Procedures

Six, on the verified build — five Landsraad plus one operational:

| Procedure | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `landsraad_insert_tasks(bigint, landsraadtask[], landsraadtaskreward[])` | seed a term's tasks |
| `landsraad_update_decrees(landsraaddecree[])` | update decrees |
| `landsraad_nominate_decrees_for_voting(bigint, integer)` | open decrees for voting |
| `landsraad_update_factions(text[])` | reconcile faction names |
| `create_event_log_partition_table(text, bigint)` | [§6](#6-partitioning) |
| `setup_user_data_encryption(boolean)` | [§4](#4-the-encryption-layer) |

### Triggers

Nine on the verified build — seven shipped by the game, two installed by this
project. Landsraad accounts for four of the game's, which is why Landsraad
writes have side effects well beyond the row you touched:

| Trigger | On table | Function |
|---|---|---|
| `landsraad_task_faction_contributions_check_task_completion` | `landsraad_task_faction_contributions` | `landsraad_check_task_completion()` |
| `landsraad_tasks_check_term_won_state` | `landsraad_tasks` | `landsraad_check_term_won()` |
| `landsraad_tasks_house_rewards_changed` | `landsraad_house_rewards` | `landsraad_notify_house_rewards_changed()` |
| `landsraad_tasks_process_house_rewards` | `landsraad_task_player_contributions` | `landsraad_process_house_rewards()` |
| `actor_fgl_entities_cleanup_orphaned_entities` | `actor_fgl_entities` | `cleanup_orphaned_entities()` |
| `normalize_farm_state_addresses` **(ours)** | `farm_state` | `normalize_farm_state_addresses()` |
| `partitions_inserted_trigger` | `world_partition` | `determine_partition_label_trigger()` |
| `trigger_create_event_log_partition` | `world_partition` | `create_event_log_partition()` |
| `console_market_history_capture` **(ours)** | `dune_exchange_fulfilled_orders` | `console_market_history.capture_fulfilled_order()` |

If you are enumerating triggers to reason about shipped game behavior, exclude
the two marked **ours**; [§9](#9-project-authored-objects) covers them.

---

## 8. Capability probes

Because the schema drifts with each build, the console does not assume any
game-owned object exists. Two helpers in `console/api/src/duneDb.js`:

```js
tableExists(db, name, schema = "dune")   // select to_regclass($1) is not null
functionExists(db, signature)            // select to_regprocedure($1) is not null
```

A missing object raises `UnsupportedCapabilityError` via `requireCapability()`,
which surfaces to the UI as an unsupported feature rather than a 500.

**The rule: a new query must probe every relation it names, including ones
reached only through a `LEFT JOIN`.** A partial probe passes, then fails in
production against the one build that dropped the un-probed table. This has
been the cause of repeated regressions.

Three objects the console still references no longer exist on the verified
build, all handled this way — they are the worked example of why the
machinery exists:

| Object | Fate | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| `dune.actor_state` | folded into `dune.actors.state` by game Patch 1.5 | legacy path retained, `duneDb.js:5307` |
| `dune.spicefield_types` | removed | `tableExists`, `duneDb.js:349` |
| `dune.get_solaris_id()` | removed | `functionExists`, `duneDb.js:1014`, `:2836` |

---

## 9. Project-authored objects

There is no conventional migration framework. Console-owned objects are
created lazily with `if not exists`, while runtime-owned objects are installed
by startup reconciliation or the compatibility patches in `runtime/sql/`.
Because some creation is lazy or conditional, **absence is not automatically
a fault**.

### Objects inside the game's schema

| Table | Created in |
|---|---|
| `dune.console_player_playtime` | `duneDb.js:1518` |
| `dune.discord_player_links` | `duneDb.js:14933` |
| `dune.discord_pending_links` | `duneDb.js:14950` |
| `dune.admin_choam_terminals` | `services/choamTerminals.js:49` |
| `dune.admin_choam_terminal_positions` | `services/choamTerminals.js` |
| `dune.player_death_log` (+2 indexes) | `deathPoller.js:39` |
| `dune.network_address_config` | `runtime/scripts/network-addresses.sh` |

`runtime/scripts/network-addresses.sh` also creates the
`dune.normalize_farm_state_addresses()` trigger function and attaches the
`normalize_farm_state_addresses` trigger to `dune.farm_state`. These are
project-owned even though they deliberately live in the game's schema.

### The `console_market_history` schema

Exchange history is the one place the console does more than add a table. In
`console/api/src/services/exchangeHistory.js` it creates its own schema, a
`transactions` table with four indexes, **a function**, and a trigger on one
of the *game's* tables:

| Object | Kind |
|---|---|
| `console_market_history` | schema |
| `console_market_history.transactions` (+4 indexes) | table |
| `console_market_history.capture_fulfilled_order()` | function |
| `console_market_history_capture` on `dune.dune_exchange_fulfilled_orders` | trigger |

Two details matter if you touch it:

- **The function swallows every exception.** Its body ends in
  `exception when others then raise warning ... return new`, deliberately:
  history capture is observability, and a schema drift or recorder fault must
  never roll back a player's market transaction. Do not "fix" this into a
  hard failure.
- **It is attached to a game-owned table.** A game build that reshapes
  `dune_exchange_fulfilled_orders` can break capture silently — the warning
  goes to the Postgres log, not the console UI.

See [exchange.md](../console/exchange.md) for the feature itself.

### The `dune_runtime` compatibility schema

The SQL patches may create `dune_runtime` for project-owned compatibility
state. The current patches create `dune_runtime.compatibility_migrations` and
can update an already-installed `guard_recovered_vehicle_restore()` function.
These objects are not part of Funcom's shipped schema.

---

## 10. Patches and drift

`runtime/scripts/update-db.sh` applies the SQL under `runtime/sql/` and
records what the game has applied in `dune.applied_patches` ([§1](#1-scope-and-vintage)). It connects
as `postgres` and reconciles trigger definitions as part of the run.

Repo-supplied patches currently in `runtime/sql/`:

- `patch-blueprint-array-bounds.sql`
- `patch-coriolis-base-backup-preservation.sql`
- `patch-vehicle-recovery-guard-schema.sql`

### Detecting drift

`runtime/scripts/schema-report.sh` regenerates everything in this document
that can go stale, against a live database:

```bash
runtime/scripts/schema-report.sh
```

It is read-only, and reports: the patch-log vintage ([§1](#1-scope-and-vintage)), object counts,
notify channels ([§7](#7-routines-and-why-direct-dml-often-does-nothing)), non-internal triggers ([§7](#7-routines-and-why-direct-dml-often-does-nothing)), and a drift check that
extracts every `dune.*` name referenced in `console/api/src` and lists the
ones that do not resolve in the database.

Container, role and database default to `dune-postgres` / `dune` / `dune`,
overridable with `DUNE_POSTGRES_CONTAINER`, `DUNE_POSTGRES_ROLE` and
`DUNE_POSTGRES_DB`.

A name in the drift list is **not automatically a bug.** It is one of:

1. correctly guarded by a capability probe ([§8](#8-capability-probes)) — the usual case;
2. a project table not yet created, because the feature or reconciliation has not run ([§9](#9-project-authored-objects));
3. prose — the extraction is textual, so `dune.<word>` in a comment or an
   error string is reported too;
4. an actual latent bug.

On the verified build the list is eight names, and none are case 4.
